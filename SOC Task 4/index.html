                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>There is a real threat of climate change and it's impact is seen with flora and fauna with an estimated 95% of all species going extinct.
                    For hundreds of years, people have theorised the techniques and methods to bring back species, and with the unlimited resources that we have, we will bring back these species.
                    There is obviously a number of people who are concerned with the reintroction of extinct species, however,as you will read below, the benefits of this will outweigh the potential of harm, provided it is properly managed and we do not loose sight of the reasons why we are doing what we are doing.
                    In order to do this, we will be using Genome Editing, utilising the CRISPR system, editing somatic (AKA not germ cells) cells.  We will be using CRISPR as opposed to Cloning due to potential issues in the quality of DNA presevered for thousands of years and to reduce risk of harm by taking out genes identified to cause cancers and diseases.

        <h2>Reasons For</h2>
        <div class="four_for">
            <div id="one" class="reason_for">
               <p>The first reason why this is good is due to increased genetic biodiversity, improving disease resistance and reduction in risk of extinction and could even reduce the risk of cancer, for example in the Tasmanian Devil, caused by one genetic mutation, that could be 'bred out'.</p> 
            </div>
            <div id="two" class="reason_for">
                <p>It can increase food security as it means previous species with positive attributes can be re-introduced, e.g. crops with improvement in drought resistance. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="three" class="reason_for">
                <p>It could actually be beneficial to climate change. For example, bringing back species that could help 'trap carbon dioxide' as found with the Wolly Mammoth and the European aurochs who actually increased grass production.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="four" class="reason_for">
                <p>Gets people interested in their surroundings! (I mean who wouldn't want to see Manny the Mammoth roaming around?)</p>

                <h3>Resources we will need to complete the genome editing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A scientist!</li>
                    <li>Some ancient DNA</li>
                    <li>Some live DNA of a relation of the ancient DNA</li>

            <h3>How we will use this technology </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To create new species to improve food security</li>
                <li>To improve current technology in genome editing which can be used for other benefits e.g. medicine and reducing cancer risk in species</li>
                <li>To investigate further into diseases and their prevention</li>

        <div class="needs failure">
            <div id="why-fail">
            <h3>Why it might fail</h3>
            <p>There are people who may be against this technology for a number of reasons, for example environmentalists concerned r.e risk to current fauna/flora e.g extinction of the dodo due to travellers and people concerned around the ethics of genetic modification of DNA. <br>
                Secondly, if we consider bringing back species, we need to think about how we would bring them back in significant numbers, and so, would things such as a ‘mammoth farm’ be required? <br>
                Thirdly, the potential risk of harm to people and the pre-existing species around. 
                <br>
                However, despite all of the potential risk for harm, as outlined in the introduction, by remembering the  importance of what we are doing and why, it is clear why this technology is needed.</p>
